A High Performance [NATS](https://nats.io) Server written in [Go.](http://golang.org)

**Note**: The `master` branch may be in an *unstable or even in a broken state* during development. Please use [releases][github-release] instead of the `master` branch in order to get stable binaries.

## Getting Started

The best way to get the nats server is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux (x86-64/ARM), and Docker. Instructions for using these binaries are on the [GitHub releases page][github-release].
You can also connect to a public server that is running at our demo site: [nats://demo.nats.io:4222](nats://demo.nats.io:4222), and a secure version at [nats://demo.nats.io:4443](nats://demo.nats.io:4443).

Of course you can build the latest version of gnatsd from the `master` branch. The master branch will always build and pass tests, but may not work correctly in your environment.
You will first need [*Go*](https://golang.org/) installed on your machine (version 1.4+ is required) to build gnatsd.

### Running

The nats server is lightweight and very performant. Starting one with no arguments will give you a server with sane default settings.

```sh
> gnatsd
[35572] 2016/01/10 08:54:16.178798 [INF] Starting gnatsd version 0.7.3
[35572] 2016/01/10 08:54:16.178940 [INF] Listening for client connections on 0.0.0.0:4222
[35572] 2016/01/10 08:54:16.179115 [INF] gnatsd is ready
```

The server will be started and listening for client connections on port 4222 from all interfaces. The logs will be displayed to stdout
as shown above. There are a large range of supported clients that can be found at [https://nats.io/clients](https://nats.io/download).
The server uses a text based protocol, so interacting with it can be as simple as using telnet.

```sh
> telnet localhost 4222
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
INFO {"server_id":"3d13165236fe601c863b6714e819fc36","version":"0.7.3","go":"go1.5.2","host":"0.0.0.0","port":4222, ...}
SUB foo 1
+OK
PUB foo 11
Hello World
+OK
MSG foo 1 11
Hello World
```

More information on the protocol can be found at [http://nats.io/documentation/internals/nats-protocol](http://nats.io/documentation/internals/nats-protocol/).

## Securing NATS

### TLS

As of Release 0.7.0, the server can use modern TLS semantics for client connections, route connections, and the HTTPS monitoring port.
The server requires TLS version 1.2, and sets preferences for modern cipher suites that avoid those known with vunerabilities. The
server's preferences when building with Go1.5 are as follows.

```go
func defaultCipherSuites() []uint16 {
	return []uint16{
		// The SHA384 versions are only in Go1.5
		tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
		tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
		tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
		tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
	}
}
```

Generating self signed certs and intermediary certificate authotities is beyond the scope here, but this document can be helpful in addition to Google Search:
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/articles/https/" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/engine/articles/https/</a>

The server **requires** a certificate and private key. Optionally the server can require that clients need to present certificates, and the server can be configured
with a CA authority to verify the client certificates.

```
# Simple TLS config file

port: 4443
net: apcera.me # net interface

tls {
  cert_file:  "./configs/certs/server-cert.pem"
  key_file:   "./configs/certs/server-key.pem"
  timeout:    0.5
}

authorization {
  user:     derek
  password: s3cr3t!
  timeout:  1
}
```

If requiring client certificates as well, simply change the TLS section as follows.

```
tls {
  cert_file: "./configs/certs/server-cert.pem"
  key_file:  "./configs/certs/server-key.pem"
  ca_file:   "./configs/certs/ca.pem"
  verify:    true
}
```

When setting up clusters, all servers in the cluster, if using TLS, will both verify the connecting endpoints and the server responses. So certificates are checked in
both directions. Certificates can be configured only for the server's cluster identity, keeping client and server certificates separate from cluster formation.

```
cluster {
  host: '127.0.0.1'
  port: 4244

  tls {
    # Route cert
    cert_file: "./configs/certs/srva-cert.pem"
    # Private key
    key_file:  "./configs/certs/srva-key.pem"
    # Optional certificate authority verifying connected routes
    # Required when we have self-signed CA, etc.
    ca_file:   "./configs/certs/ca.pem"
  }
  # Routes are actively solicited and connected to from this server.
  # Other servers can connect to us if they supply the correct credentials
  # in their routes definitions from above.
  routes = [
    nats-route://127.0.0.1:4246
  ]
}
```
The server can be run using command line arguments to enable TLS functionality.

```
--tls                        Enable TLS, do not verify clients (default: false)
--tlscert FILE               Server certificate file
--tlskey FILE                Private key for server certificate
--tlsverify                  Enable TLS, very client certificates
--tlscacert FILE             Client certificate CA for verification
```

Examples using the test certicates which are self signed for localhost and 127.0.0.1.
```bash
gnatsd --tls --tlscert=./test/configs/certs/server-cert.pem --tlskey=./test/configs/certs/server-key.pem

[15139] 2015/12/03 12:37:18.963635 [INF] Starting gnatsd version 0.7.0
[15139] 2015/12/03 12:37:18.963710 [INF] Listening for client connections on 0.0.0.0:4222
[15139] 2015/12/03 12:37:18.963874 [INF] TLS required for client connections
[15139] 2015/12/03 12:37:18.963878 [INF] gnatsd is ready
```

Notice that the log  indicates that the client connections will be required to use TLS. If you run the server in Debug mode with -D or -DV, the logs will show the cipher suite selection for each connected client.
```
[15146] 2015/12/03 12:38:37.733139 [DBG] ::1:63330 - cid:1 - Starting TLS client connection handshake
[15146] 2015/12/03 12:38:37.751948 [DBG] ::1:63330 - cid:1 - TLS handshake complete
[15146] 2015/12/03 12:38:37.751959 [DBG] ::1:63330 - cid:1 - TLS version 1.2, cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
```


If you want the server to enforce and require client certificates as well via the command line, utilize this example.

```
gnatsd --tlsverify --tlscert=./test/configs/certs/server-cert.pem --tlskey=./test/configs/certs/server-key.pem --tlscacert=./test/configs/certs/ca.pem
```


### Bcrypt

In addition to TLS functionality, the server now also supports bcrypt for passwords and tokens. This is transparent and you can simply replace the plaintext password in the configuration with the bcrypt hash, the server will automatically utilize bcrypt as needed.

There is a utility bundled under /util/mkpasswd. By default with no arguments it will generate a secure password and the associated hash. This can be used for a password or a token in the configuration. If you already have a password selected, you can supply that on stdin with the -p flag.

```bash
~/go/src/github.com/nats-io/gnatsd/util> ./mkpasswd
pass: #IclkRPHUpsTmACWzmIGXr
bcrypt hash: $2a$11$3kIDaCxw.Glsl1.u5nKa6eUnNDLV5HV9tIuUp7EHhMt6Nm9myW1aS
```

Add into the server configuration file's authorization section.
```
  authorization {
    user: derek
    password: $2a$11$3kIDaCxw.Glsl1.u5nKa6eUnNDLV5HV9tIuUp7EHhMt6Nm9myW1aS
  }
```

## Monitoring

If the monitoring port is enabled, the server will run a lightweight http server that has several endpoints defined, **[/varz, /connz, /routez, /subsz]**. All endpoints return a JSON object.

To test, run '``gnatsd -m 8222``', then go to <a href="http://localhost:8222/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8222/</a>

### /varz

<a href="http://localhost:8222/varz" target="_blank">http://localhost:8222/varz</a> reports various general statistics.

  }
}
```

### /connz

<a href="http://localhost:8222/connz" target="_blank">http://localhost:8222/connz</a> reports more detailed information on current connections. It uses a paging mechanism which defaults to 1024 connections.
You can control these via url arguments (limit and offset), e.g. <a href="http://localhost:8222/connz?limit=1&offset=1" target="_blank">http://localhost:8222/connz?limit=1&offset=1</a>.
You can also report detailed subscription information on a per connection basis using subs=1, e.g. <a href="http://localhost:8222/connz?limit=1&offset=1&subs=1" target="_blank">http://localhost:8222/connz?limit=1&offset=1&subs=1</a>.

      "subscriptions_list": [
        "hello.world"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### /routez

<a href="http://localhost:8222/routez" target="_blank">http://localhost:8222/routez</a> reports information on active routes for a cluster. Routes are expected to be low, so there is no paging mechanism currently with this endpoint. It does support the subs arg line /connz, e.g. <a href="http://localhost:8222/routez?subs=1" target="_blank">http://localhost:8222/routez?subs=1</a>

```json
{
  "now": "2015-07-14T13:30:59.349179963-07:00",
  "num_routes": 1,
  "routes": [
    {
      "rid": 1,
      "remote_id": "de475c0041418afc799bccf0fdd61b47",
      "did_solicit": true,
      "ip": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 61791,
      "pending_size": 0,
      "in_msgs": 0,
      "out_msgs": 0,
      "in_bytes": 0,
      "out_bytes": 0,
      "subscriptions": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### /subsz

<a href="http://localhost:8222/subsz" target="_blank">http://localhost:8222/subsz</a> reports detailed information about the current subscriptions and the routing data structure.

```json
{
  "num_subscriptions": 3,
  "num_cache": 0,
  "num_inserts": 572,
  "num_removes": 569,
  "num_matches": 200000,
  "cache_hit_rate": 0.99999,
  "max_fanout": 0,
  "avg_fanout": 0,
  "stats_time": "2015-07-14T12:55:25.564818051-07:00"
}
```

Monitoring endpoints support JSONP for CORS so you can easily create single page
web applications for monitoring. Simply pass `callback` query parameter to any
endpoint. For example; `http://localhost:8222/connz?callback=cb`

```javascript
// JQuery example

$.getJSON('http://localhost:8222/connz?callback=?', function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});

```

## Building

This code currently requires at _least_ version 1.4 of Go, but we encourage
the use of the latest stable release.  We will be moving to requiring at _least_ 1.5
in the near future. Go is still young and improving
rapidly, new releases provide performance improvements and fixes.  Information
on installation, including pre-built binaries, is available at
<http://golang.org/doc/install>.  Stable branches of operating system
packagers provided by your OS vendor may not be sufficient.

Run `go version` to see the version of Go which you have installed.

Run `go build` inside the directory to build.

Run `go test ./...` to run the unit regression tests.

A successful build run produces no messages and creates an executable called
`gnatsd` in this directory.  You can invoke that binary, with no options and
no configuration file, to start a server with acceptable standalone defaults
(no authentication, no clustering).

Run `go help` for more guidance, and visit <http://golang.org/> for tutorials,
presentations, references and more.
